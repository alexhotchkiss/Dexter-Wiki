  <h1>Who is Dexter Morgan?</h1>
  <p>Dexter considers himself 
    emotionally divorced from 
    the rest of humanity; in his 
    narration, he refers to "humans" 
    as if he is not one himself. 
    He makes frequent references 
    to an internal feeling of emptiness 
    and says he kills to feel alive. 
    He claims to have no feelings or 
    conscience, and that all of his 
    emotional responses are part of 
    a well-rehearsed act to conceal 
    his true nature. He has no interest 
    in romance or sex; he considers his 
    relationship with his girlfriend (
      and eventual wife) Rita Bennett 
      to be part of his "disguise".</p>
