          <h1>Who is Dexter Morgan?</h1>
          <p>Dexter considers himself 
            emotionally divorced from 
            the rest of humanity; in his 
            narration, he refers to "humans" 
            as if he is not one himself. 
            He makes frequent references 
            to an internal feeling of emptiness 
            and says he kills to feel alive. 
            He claims to have no feelings or 
            conscience, and that all of his 
            emotional responses are part of 
            a well-rehearsed act to conceal 
            his true nature. He has no interest 
            in romance or sex; he considers his 
            relationship with his girlfriend (
              and eventual wife) Rita Bennett 
              to be part of his "disguise".</p>
